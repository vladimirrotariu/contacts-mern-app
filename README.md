# ContacsApp

## Description

An app to store your contacts, with information such as name, age, email, and phone number.

* CHECK THE WEBSITE AND INTERACT (I.E. INTRODUCE A CONTACT) HERE: [Live Site](https://contacts-mern-app.vercel.app/)

## Testing

We performed **unit tests** using the **Testing Library** on the **React components**, thus ensuring that we develop an accessible web app. For a detailed analysis about the tests, one might check the [istanbul report](https://istanbul-reports.vercel.app/).

## Query our MongoDB database deployed on Atlas
For example, with 
```
curl "https://contacts-09i3.onrender.com/contacts"
```
one might get a rough idea of the contacts stored in our MongoDB database.
